# Online-IDE
Online IDE using Php
(The project is compelete but the UI/UX might be changed in future)

The project needs to be run on a local server if you dont run it on a local server then the compiler wouldnt compile anything
and also the you need to change the interpreter path since its based on my directory.

Any changes in the compiler will be appreciated.
